Use your Steam page to clearly explain your platform and direct users to your main site and mobile downloads.
- **Epic Games Store:**
  - Another large platform for desktop apps and games. Listing here can reach a different segment of users.
- **Microsoft Store:**
  - Useful for Windows users who prefer downloading apps from the official store.

  - For Mac users, being present here can increase trust and ease of installation.
- **Alternative Android App Stores:**
  - Consider stores like Amazon Appstore, Samsung Galaxy Store, or Huawei AppGallery for additional mobile reach.

> **Note:** These platforms are best used as secondary channels for discoverability and legitimacy. Always keep your main onboarding and user flow on your website and official mobile apps.

*This strategy will help maximize exposure and drive adoption among students, clubs, and SMEs. Adjust and expand as your platform grows!* 

## 11. Ethical Promotion & Community Engagement
- **Never use fake reviews or astroturfing:**
  - Creating fake Reddit posts, reviews, or testimonials is unethical, against most platforms’ rules, and can seriously damage your reputation if discovered.
  - Reddit users, in particular, are skilled at spotting inauthentic or “shill” content. Getting caught can result in bans and long-term distrust.
- **Be transparent and honest:**
  - If you want to promote your platform on Reddit or similar forums, do so openly. Share your journey as a founder, ask for feedback, and participate in “Show Off” or “Feedback” threads.
  - Disclose your affiliation with the product when posting about it.
- **Leverage real users:**
  - Encourage your early adopters to share their genuine experiences on Reddit, forums, or social media.
  - Run beta programs or invite-only launches and ask for honest feedback and organic posts.
- **Engage with the community:**
  - Become an active, helpful member of relevant subreddits and forums. Answer questions, offer advice, and build relationships.
  - People are more likely to check out your platform if you’re seen as authentic and helpful.
- **Use Reddit Ads for promotion:**
  - If you want to reach a wider audience, consider using Reddit’s self-serve ads, which are clearly marked as “Promoted” and are allowed by the platform.
- **Best practices for sustainable growth:**
  - Focus on building a real, engaged community around your platform.
  - Collect and act on feedback, and let your users become your advocates.
  - Remember: real buzz and word-of-mouth are far more valuable than any fake post could ever be.

> **Summary:** Always choose transparency and authenticity over shortcuts. Sustainable growth comes from real users, honest engagement, and a reputation for trustworthiness. 

## 12. Alignment with Proven Playbooks (e.g., Gather)
Your distribution strategy closely mirrors the approach used by successful platforms like Gather (formerly Gather Town):

- **Freemium Model & Viral Loops:**
  - A generous free tier encourages users to try the platform and invite others, driving organic growth.
- **Targeting Students, Clubs, and SMEs:**
  - Early traction comes from highly networked groups who share tools that work for them.
- **Community & Social Features:**
  - Emphasizing social interaction and collaboration makes the platform “sticky” and encourages word of mouth.
- **Leveraging Online Communities & Content:**
  - Using Reddit, Discord, Facebook groups, and content marketing to build buzz and reach new users.
- **Partnerships & Events:**
  - Collaborating with universities, clubs, and events to seed large user bases and gain press coverage.
- **Press, Product Hunt, and App Stores:**
  - Launching on Product Hunt, app stores, and even platforms like Steam for extra exposure.

### What You’re Doing Right
- Applying proven tactics to your unique platform and audience.
- Focusing on organic, community-driven growth.
- Planning for long-term sustainability, not just a quick viral spike.

### What to Watch For
- **Messaging:** Ensure your platform’s purpose is clear to avoid mismatched expectations.
- **Onboarding:** Make it easy for new users to invite others and get value quickly.
- **Community:** Foster a sense of belonging and encourage sharing to turn users into advocates.

### Summary Table: Gather’s Playbook vs. Your Strategy

| Gather’s Playbook         | Your Strategy? | Notes                        |
|---------------------------|:--------------:|------------------------------|

| Partnerships/Events       |      ✓         | Universities, clubs, SMEs    |
| Product Hunt/App Stores   |      ✓         | Extra exposure               |

> **In short:** This strategy is validated by successful platforms and is well-suited for viral, community-driven growth. Execute well, listen to your users, and keep iterating for the best chance of success. 

## 13. Local Student Adoption (e.g., QUT, UQ, Brisbane Universities)

As of now, there is no public evidence of adoption at QUT, UQ, or other local universities. To drive local student adoption:

- **Pilot Program:**
  - Reach out to student clubs, societies, or IT departments at QUT, UQ, and other local universities.
  - Offer free trials, demos, or sponsor a club event to get your platform in front of students.
- **Campus Ambassadors:**
  - Recruit students as ambassadors to promote and gather feedback on campus.
- **Local Events:**
  - Attend or sponsor hackathons, club fairs, or student networking events in Brisbane.
- **Direct Outreach:**
  - Email or DM club leaders, student union reps, or relevant faculty with a personalized pitch.
- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Encourage early users to give feedback and testimonials, which you can use to build credibility for further outreach.

**Why Local Adoption Matters:**
- Social proof (“used by clubs at QUT and UQ”) builds trust for other students and organizations.
- Local students provide direct, actionable feedback to refine your product for the Australian university context.
- Once a few clubs or societies adopt your platform, word can spread quickly across campus.

> **Action:** Consider drafting outreach emails, a campus ambassador program, or a pilot proposal for QUT/UQ clubs to kickstart local adoption.
