## Overview

---

## 1. Student & University Funding

### **University Accelerators**

#### **Melbourne Accelerator Program (MAP)**
The Melbourne Accelerator Program is one of Australia's most prestigious university accelerators, run by the University of Melbourne. They provide $20,000 in cash funding plus an additional $10,000 worth of in-kind services including workspace, legal support, and professional services. The program runs for six months and is designed to help student and alumni startups develop their business model, build their product, and connect with investors.

**What they want in return:** MAP doesn't take any equity in your company, which is unusual for accelerators. However, they do expect you to fully participate in their intensive program, which includes regular workshops, mentoring sessions, and networking events. They want you to be committed to building your business and willing to learn from their extensive network of mentors and advisors. They also expect you to represent the university well and potentially become a success story they can showcase.

**Conditions:** You must be a current student or recent alumni of the University of Melbourne, have a working prototype of your product, and be part of a team of at least two people. The program requires full-time commitment, meaning you'll need to be able to dedicate significant time to the program activities. You'll also need to be based in Melbourne for the duration of the program and be willing to participate in all scheduled events and activities.

**Application process:** The application process is highly competitive, with only 10-15% of applicants being accepted. You'll need to submit a detailed application including your business plan, financial projections, team information, and a compelling pitch for why your business should be selected. The process includes multiple rounds of interviews and may require you to present your business to a panel of judges. The entire process from application to acceptance typically takes 3-6 months.

Local councils offer various grant programs to support businesses in their area. These grants typically range from $5,000 to $25,000 and are designed to stimulate local economic development. The council wants to see that your business will benefit the local community, create jobs, or contribute to the local economy in some way. They don't take any equity in your company, but they do expect you to meet certain conditions.

**What they want in return:** The council expects you to create local employment opportunities, contribute to the local economy, and demonstrate how your business will benefit the community. They may require you to report on your progress, attend local business events, or participate in council initiatives. Some councils also expect you to source materials or services locally when possible.

**Conditions:** You must be operating within the council's geographic boundaries, have a valid business registration, and demonstrate that your business will have a positive impact on the local community. Most councils require you to submit regular reports on your progress and may conduct site visits to verify your business operations. You may also be required to attend networking events or participate in council business development programs.

**Application process:** You'll need to submit a detailed business plan, financial projections, and a clear explanation of how your business benefits the local community. The council will review your application and may request additional information or conduct interviews. The process typically takes 2-4 months from application to funding.

#### **Business Development Grants**
These are matching grants where the council provides funding equal to what you invest in your business. The amounts range from $10,000 to $50,000, meaning if you invest $20,000 in your business, the council will match it with another $20,000. This is designed to encourage business investment and growth in the local area.

**What they want in return:** The council expects you to invest your own money first, then they'll match it. They want to see that you're committed to your business and willing to put your own capital at risk. They also expect you to create jobs, increase your business capacity, or expand your operations in a way that benefits the local economy.

**Conditions:** You must be able to demonstrate that you have the matching funds available and that you're investing them in legitimate business development activities. The council will require detailed financial records and may conduct audits to ensure the funds are being used appropriately. You'll also need to provide regular reports on how the funding has helped your business grow and benefit the local community.

**Application process:** You'll need to provide detailed financial information, including proof of your matching funds, a comprehensive business plan, and clear documentation of how you plan to use the grant money. The council will conduct due diligence on your business and may require security or guarantees. The process typically takes 3-6 months and involves multiple rounds of review and approval.

## Conclusion

**Funding in Australia is possible, but requires preparation, persistence, and patience. Start with the easiest sources (student programs, grants) and work your way up to more competitive sources (VCs).**

**The key is building traction first - most funding sources require proof that people want your product. Focus on users and revenue before applying for funding.**

**Remember: funding is a means to an end, not the end goal. Many successful startups bootstrap their way to success.**
