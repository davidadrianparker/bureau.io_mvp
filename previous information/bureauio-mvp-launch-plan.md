# Bureau.io MVP Launch Plan (Phased Approach)

## Overview
This document outlines a phased plan for launching the Bureau.io MVP, supporting up to 100 users who can create and manage their own bureaus (rooms/servers) with 2D and 3D environments, real-time chat, file sharing, Google/Microsoft login, PayPal payments, video calls, and basic productivity tools (whiteboard and sticky notes). The plan is broken into **phases**, each representing a focused MVP iteration. Each phase is designed to validate core assumptions, gather user feedback, and minimize risk and cost.

---

## Phased MVP Rollout Summary
- **Each phase is a mini-MVP:** Build, test, and validate a small set of features before moving to the next.
- **Early users are kept in the loop:** Collect emails, invite for each phase, and gather feedback.
- **Servers can be shut down between phases to save cost.**
- **You do NOT need to replace Discord immediately—focus on learning and iteration.**

---

## Phase 1: Core Communication MVP
**Goal:** Validate that users want to use Bureau.io for basic chat and rooms.

### Features
- User registration/login (Google, Microsoft)
- User profile management
- Create/join bureaus (rooms/servers)
- Real-time text chat in bureaus
- User presence (who’s online)

### Integrations
- Google/Microsoft OAuth2 (Firebase/Auth0 or direct OAuth2)
- Simple database (Postgres/MySQL)
- Basic cloud hosting (Heroku/Vercel/AWS)

### What to Test/Validate
- Do users sign up and create bureaus?
- Is chat reliable and easy to use?
- Do users return?

---

## Phase 2: File Sharing & Admin Tools
**Goal:** See if users need to share files and require admin/moderation features.

### Features
- File sharing in bureaus (upload/download)
- Admin roles (manage members, kick/ban, set permissions)
- Basic moderation (delete messages/files, report abuse)
- Invite system (email or link)

### Integrations
- AWS S3, Firebase Storage, or Google Cloud Storage

### What to Test/Validate
- Do users upload and download files?
- Are admin/moderation tools used?
- Any abuse or spam issues?

---

## Phase 3: 3D Room (Basic)
**Goal:** Test if users care about a 3D environment and if it adds value.

### Features
- Basic 3D room (Unity WebGL or Three.js)
- Sync 3D room with 2D chat (users, presence, chat messages)
- Sticky notes in 2D/3D rooms

### Integrations
- Unity WebGL/Three.js
- Real-time sync (WebSockets/Firebase)

### What to Test/Validate
- Do users enter the 3D room?
- Is the 3D experience valuable or just a novelty?
- Do users use sticky notes?

---

## Phase 4: Video Calls
**Goal:** Validate demand for video meetings in 2D and 3D rooms.

### Features
- Webcam/video call support in 2D and 3D rooms

### Integrations
- Jitsi Meet (self-hosted or SaaS), Daily.co, Twilio Video, or Agora.io

### What to Test/Validate
- Do users start and join video calls?
- Is video quality and UX acceptable?
- Do users want video in 3D, or is 2D enough?

---

## Phase 5: Productivity Tools
**Goal:** See if users use collaborative whiteboard and sticky notes for real work.

### Features
- Collaborative whiteboard (shared drawing/annotation space in each bureau)
- Enhanced sticky notes (if needed)

### Integrations
- Excalidraw, tldraw, or similar open-source whiteboard

### What to Test/Validate
- Do users use the whiteboard?
- Is it a core feature or a distraction?

---

## Phase 6: Payments & Premium Features
**Goal:** Test willingness to pay for premium features (e.g., premium bureaus, extra storage, advanced tools).

### Features
- PayPal payments for premium features
- Premium feature gating (e.g., more rooms, larger file uploads)

### Integrations
- PayPal SDK

### What to Test/Validate
- Do users pay for premium features?
- Which features drive upgrades?

---

## Team Requirements & Skills (Applies to All Phases)
- **Full-Stack Developer:** React/Vue, Node.js/Python, REST API, DB, OAuth2, file upload, UI/UX, whiteboard/sticky notes integration
- **3D/Frontend Developer (optional):** Unity/Three.js, avatars/rooms, sync with backend
- **Designer (optional):** Figma, wireframes, user flows
- **DevOps/Cloud (optional):** Deploy, monitor, backup, cloud storage

### Realistic Timelines
- **Solo founder:** 12–30 months (part-time, learning, bug fixing, iteration, maintenance)
- **2–3 person team:** 6–18 months (depending on experience and availability)
- **Agency:** 3–6 months (expensive, fastest)

## Cost Estimates (Per Phase)
| Item                        | Tool/Service         | Cost Estimate (per month) |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Cloud Hosting               | Heroku/Vercel/AWS    | $30–$100                  |
| Database                    | Managed Postgres     | $10–$30                   |
| File Storage                | AWS S3/Firebase      | $5–$30                    |
| Domain/SSL/Email            | Namecheap, etc.      | $10 (avg, annualized)     |
| PayPal Fees                 | PayPal               | 2.6% + $0.30 per txn      |
| Video Calls (3rd party)     | Jitsi (self-hosted)  | Free–$20                  |
|                             | Daily/Twilio/Agora   | Free–$30 (low usage)      |
| Email Notifications         | Mailgun/SendGrid     | Free–$15                  |
| Monitoring/Analytics        | Sentry, Plausible    | Free–$20                  |
| **Total (est.)**            |                      | **$75–$250/month**        |

- **One-time costs:** $200–$500 for initial setup, domain, design assets, and possible plugin licenses.
- **If you use only free tiers and open-source:** You can keep costs at the low end, but expect to upgrade as usage grows or for better reliability.
- **Ongoing maintenance:** Budget time and some cost for bug fixes, updates, and user support after launch.

## Launch Checklist (Per Phase)
- [ ] Build and test features for the current phase
- [ ] Collect user emails and invite testers
- [ ] Run a limited-time test (spin up server, gather feedback)
- [ ] Shut down server to save cost between phases
- [ ] Analyze feedback and usage data
- [ ] Decide what to keep, cut, or improve for next phase
- [ ] Communicate with users about next steps

---

## Final Advice
- Start with the smallest, simplest MVP phase—add features only as users request them.
- Use open-source and managed services to keep costs and complexity down.
- Test with friends/family before opening to 100 users.
- Monitor usage and errors closely in each phase.
- Be ready to fix bugs and answer questions quickly.
- **Expect delays and ongoing work:** Real-world projects always take longer and require more maintenance than planned, especially for solo founders or small teams.
- **Iterate based on real user feedback, not assumptions.**
